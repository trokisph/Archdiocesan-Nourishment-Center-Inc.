<p>
To respond to Pope Francis’ challenge to go and bring Christ’s message of love even “to the fringes of society”, the Archdiocese of Davao, through its Archdiocesan Council of the Lay Apostolate and Integrated Movements (ACLAIM), launched the Archdiocesan Nourishment Center (ANC) on May 19, 2015. 
</p>
<p>
The Center aims to provide integral nourishment programs and services such as spiritual formation, medical assistance especially to the poorest of the poor, and feeding of malnourished children in the city. 
</p>
<p>
Located at Pag-asa st. Fatima, Davao City, the ANC building is furnished with an air-conditioned chapel which became a venue for perpetual adoration to the Blessed Sacrament. It has a spacious session hall that accommodates around 80 people, a kitchen and a dining hall that holds 100 children, and a clinic for medical and dental doctors who conducts free check-up and consultations weekly on voluntary basis. 
</p>
<p>
The said building, which was renovated free of charge by the HR Construction Corporation through the generousity of Mr. and Mrs. Willie and Carrie Ho, used to be the home for the sick and the aged, handled by the sisters of the Missionaries of Charity. On two occasions, Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta stayed in the said house during her visit to Davao City more than three decades ago.

<p>
Msgr. Paul A. Cuison, the Archdiocesan Episcopal Vicar for the Laity at that time, said the ANC drawns also its inspiration from <strong>Blessed Mother Teresa's love for the poor and the hungry</strong>. This champion of the poor once said, <strong>“if you cannot feed 100 children, then feed one”</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
The launching of ANC started with the celebration of the Holy Eucharist at around 9am, presided by Archbishop Romulo G. Valles, and followed by the whole blessing of the said house. 
</p>
<p>
Among its honored guests was then City Mayor Rodrigo R. Duterte, Priests, Lay Leaders and some benefactors also graced the event. 
</p>
<p>
Spearheaded by the lay faithful of the archdiocese, the ANC is their response to the challenge of the CBCP in clearing 2014 as the year of the laity. 
</p>
<p>
Pope Francis, during the last World Youth Day in Rio de Janerio, challenged the young people: <strong>“Go, do not be afraid, and serve”</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The lay faithful of the Archdiocese of Davao, guided by their zealous pastors, responded ardently to the Pope’s call and was not afraid <strong>“to go and to bring Christ into every area of life, to the fringes of society, even to those who seem farthest away”</strong>, the poorest of the poor.
